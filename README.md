This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving unsafe raw pointers and how to fix it using safe Rust practices.  The `bug.rs` file shows the problematic code, which directly manipulates a vector's memory using `as_mut_ptr()`.  The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version that avoids undefined behavior by employing safe Rust techniques.  Understanding the nuances of raw pointers in Rust is crucial for writing robust and reliable code.
